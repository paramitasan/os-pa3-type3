/*
 * vmsim.c -- Programming Assignment 3, the file YOU edit.
 *
 * Out of the box this runs FIFO, which is given to you complete as a worked
 * example and is also the baseline every topic is compared against. Run it,
 * read it, check its numbers against the published answer in README.md, and
 * then replace the body of choose_victim() with your own algorithm.
 *
 * You write two functions:
 *
 *     choose_victim()      the replacement decision. Usually under 15 lines.
 *     print_topic_extra()  your topic's own extra output.
 *
 * You should not need to change anything else in the kit.

 * Choose which frame to throw out, and return its index.
 *
 * The library calls this ONLY when a page fault has happened and every frame
 * is already full, so you never have to look for a free frame. The page being
 * brought in is sim->ref[sim->t].
 *
 * What you have to work with, for each frame i in 0 .. sim->nframes-1:
 *
 *     sim->frame[i].page        the page number resident there
 *     sim->frame[i].load_time   when it was brought in        -> FIFO
 *     sim->frame[i].last_used   when it was last referenced   -> LRU
 *     sim->frame[i].uses        how many times referenced     -> LFU, MFU
 *     sim->frame[i].ref_bit     reference bit                 -> Second Chance
 *     sim->frame[i].dirty_bit   modify bit                    -> Enhanced S.C.
 *     sim->frame[i].age         8-bit shift register          -> Aging
 *     sim->hand                 the clock hand, yours to move -> Second Chance
 *
 * and these helpers:
 *
 *     next_use(sim, page, from) when `page` is referenced again, or sim->nrefs
 *     find_page(sim, page)      which frame holds a page, or -1
 *
 * TIE-BREAKING: whenever two frames are equally good victims, choose the
 * LOWER FRAME INDEX, unless your topic's ASSIGNMENT.md says otherwise.
 * Every answer in the key is computed that way, so a different tie-break will
 * not match and you will not be able to reproduce your own results.
